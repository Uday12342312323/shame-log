This is your **public archive of failure.**
Generated, maintained, and ruthlessly updated by the [ShameLock](https://github.com/accidental-mvp/shamelock) browser extension.

Whenever you open a blocked site during a focus session, this repo gets updated. Automatically. Without mercy.

## 💡 Purpose

This repo isn't here to help you improve.
It's here to remember when you didn't.

A historical log of your digital distractions.
A monument to your inability to stay off Twitter.
A shrine to procrastination — maintained by code.

## 🔒 Privacy
This is **your** repo.  
Clone it, make it private, or share it publicly if you're feeling bold and broken.

ShameLock doesn’t read your data — it just writes down your regret.
